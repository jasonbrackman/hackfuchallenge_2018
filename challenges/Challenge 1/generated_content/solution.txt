The carving knife shakes in your grip as you stroke the last word in the final space on the wall. You step back to admire your handiwork and release the breath you didn't realise you'd been holding.

Nothing happens. You study your carving. Did you get the riddle wrong? Was your carving not legible enough? Come to think of it, that "f" in field looks a little too much like a "t"... and the "p" in "pit" is justâ€“

The phrase lights up like the poem above it, assuaging any doubts about your woodcarving skills. You hear a soft click, and almost jump a foot in the air as the door to your cell swings open all by itself.

You peek through the open door and glance side to side. The hallway is empty. Either the door was opened by the world's fastest and quietest hundred-metre sprinter, or you really are dealing with magic. You'd like to believe the former, but as your grandmother's old stories surface from your memories, the latter starts to look like the more plausible explanation. Though the wall has now gone out, the impression of its pulsing, glowing letters remains lodged in your mind.

But there's no time to worry about that now. By whatever means, you're free from your tiny prison and able to roam the ship. If you can find a radio, perhaps you can get a distress message out to the authorities -- or at least let someone know where you are and that you're still alive.

You sneak out of the room and creep down the hallway, ever mindful of your surroundings. You peel your eyes and focus your ears. Nothing escapes your senses.

... until you round a corner and find yourself locking eyes with the ship's captain.

A tense silence hangs in the air. The thought of attempting to dodge past the captain or push her out of the way briefly enters your mind, but is swiftly chased out by a horde of bloodthirsty imaginary pirates.

Finally, the captain speaks. "Well," she says. "I didn't expect to you outside of your chambers just yet. I'd ask who let you out, but I know that no-one has been down that way since we locked you in."

The captain's eyes narrow. "I'd ask how you escaped, but it's not my way to fuss over details. You escaped, and by our policy aboard this fine ship Hurricane, that elevates your status a way from mere cargo. You're dangerous cargo, and that entitles you to an invitation to join our crew."

You catch yourself before letting out a sigh of relief. You don't want to let your guard down just yet.

"I extend that invitation to you now," the captain says, extending a hand.

You allow her hand to hang in the air while you consider your options.

The captain frowns at your reluctance. "The alternative to joining our crew, for dangerous cargo we can not afford to throw overboard" -- she pauses here for just a moment -- "is dismemberment. You won't need limbs to translate."

Before the captain finishes the word "limbs" you're already shaking her hand and thanking her profusely for this wonderful career opportunity.
